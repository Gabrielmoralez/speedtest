Note:
This code does not calculate real internet speed data; it simulates it through fictional calculations.
 This site is purely for testing purposes. If you have any suggestions or ideas for improving the simulation, 
 feel free to reach out. If you'd like to use this code for any other purpose, please contact me. :-)
